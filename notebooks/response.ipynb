      "In 2025, AI is expected to show real value from past investments, transitioning from exploration to solving real problems such as reducing costs, generating revenue, and improving customer experiences. AI will become smarter and more accurate, enabling it to perform tasks on behalf of users. Significant progress is anticipated in AI's ability to see and process information visually, alongside a reduction in reliability issues known as hallucinations. Additionally, there will be a push to integrate AI into various products and services, leading to the development of contextual agents that adapt to user needs. The hope is that these agents will operate in the background, making daily tasks easier and allowing users to focus more on human interactions.\n",
